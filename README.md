About:

My journey through the development scenery started early this year in February 2022. After working for nearly 4 years 
in Digital Marketing, I was approached by Aarimâ€™s CEO, Victor Coutinho, and he asked if he could call me to have a little 
chat. I said yes, after all you never know what to expect, right? At this call he started saying that I had 
a good logical thinking and some experience with databases and programming, I agreed although was still clueless as to the 
point he wanted to get to. Then, he asked if I would like to migrate to the development team. At first, I was stunned 
by the proposition, he then asked me to watch some courses about the language used for our product and to give him a 
"yes or no" answer by the end of the next week.

Shortly after I started watching some courses on C# development (the main language used by the development team) 
and it started growing on me, after each chapter of the course I found myself wondering what it would be like to work 
as a developer. Two weeks after our talk, I said yes to Victorâ€™s proposal and started my new position officially.

At the moment I look for ways to enhance my development abilities and learn new languages and technologies.
